# Smart-Home-Security
Created for PRD Class final Project. <br>
A home-security system that could detect door movement using reed switch and detect fire or smoke with MQ gas sensor. System used NodeMCU to read sensor data and send alert via HTTP protocol to IFTTT service that could make notification into your smartphone when either gas sensor or reed switch is triggered.
